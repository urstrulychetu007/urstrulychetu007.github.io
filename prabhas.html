        <p>
          Prabhas made his debut in the Telugu film industry with the movie Eeshwar
          in the year 2002. Much was expected from the movie, however, it failed to
          impress the audience and was termed as an `average hit`. Likewise, Prabhas
          failed to leave an impression on the box office with his second release as
          well. His second movie, Raghuvendra, which was released in 2003, also
          wasn`t well received by the audience. However, his next movie, Varsham
          (2004), which also starred Trisha Krishnan and Gopichand, was commercially
          successful. Varsham marked his stardom in the Telugu film industry and
          Prabhas also won the Best Young Performer at the Santosham Film Awards and
          his co-star, Trisha, bagged the Filmfare Best Actress award for the movie.

          Following his success with Varsham, Prabhas` next movie was highly
          anticipated. However, his next movie, Adavi Ramdu (2004), received
          negative reception at the box office and and failed to live up to the
          audience`s expectation.

          ran for over a 100 days at around 54 cinema theaters. It was a huge hit
          and his screen presence was highly praised. However, for a second time in
          a row in his career, Prabhas followed a hit with a movie which
          disappointed his fans. His next release in 2006, Pournami, proved to be a
          failure at the box office.
