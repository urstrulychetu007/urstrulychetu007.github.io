            A famous saying that exits states there is no other bond stronger

            unconditionally like no one else ever could or can. We are a living
            part of our parents, and our entire existence is because of
            them,hence whatever we do to repay them willl be much less in
            comparision to what they have done for us. My mother is the living
            example of god in my life,and She is my mother who strives to keep
            up safe. She is my mother.Her name is

            father is the one whom I go to when I can’t handle anything in life.
            He is the one who has taught me all the good manners and ethics in
            life. He will guide me in every decision of my life. Whenever there
            is a problem in life he is there to support me in all my ups and
            downs. My dad believes in simple living and high thinking and tries
